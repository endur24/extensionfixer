# extensionfixer
Have you ever baught or downloaded an html template and expected it to work offline but it could not load some or most of the files even though the files are in the right directories in your computer? Usually its because of the file names and extension they have. This python file(extensionfixer.py) will rename the files *removing the bad extension*.

Quick rename files in directories which bad extensions. e.g myfile.eot?v1 to myfile.eot, myfile.js?v=1 to myfile.js etc

# Usage
- Download the extensionfixer.py file.
- Place it in the directory where you want to rename files in.
- run python extensionfixer.py
